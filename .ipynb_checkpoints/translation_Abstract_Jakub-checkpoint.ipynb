    "Canonical Loop Quantum Gravity is a nonperturbative theory of quantum dynamics of the Einsteinian gravitational field. Being a proposal of quantization of General Relativity, it satisfies the equivalence principle. Therefore its formalism can be naturally extended on matter fields. For simplicity we consider only bosonic degrees of freedom."

    "Canonical framework is based on the Ashtekar formulation of General Relativity with an explicitly written SU(2) symmetry. The theory is regulated on a graph Γ, introducing a parameter ε, being the value of the length of links. The quantization is performed analogically to lattice gauge theories. The Hamiltonian for gravitational field takes the form of a sum of three constraints. Two of them impose SU(2) symmetry and spatial diffeomorphism invariance, while the scalar constraint describes dynamics. <font color='red'>The Hilbert space for Loop Quantum Gravity is a product of Wigner matrices and intertwiners.</font> The first ones, attach a spin in some irreducible representation to the links of Γ, while the intertwiners implement SU(2) invariance on the nodes."

    "A diffeomorphism invariant, background independent and properly densitized representation of matter fields can be constructed by analogy to gravity. Vector field operators are built from the lattice-smeared electric and magnetic fields. In the case of the scalar field there is an ambiguity in construction of new representations for fundamental variables, since the covariant derivative of a field and the scalar field potential are topological. However the action of the Hamiltonian operator is independent of this choice as long as the new fundamental fields are properly densitized (i.e. they are pseudoforms)."

    "We constructed well defined Hamiltonian operators for all Standard Model bosonic fields and gravity. Considering models with diagonal spatial metric, we get analytical matrix elements. It does not break the equivalence principle as long as one chooses diagonal degrees of freedom after quantization. The results are regulator independent at the leading order and they reproduce appropriate classical expressions. The next to the leading order corrections read 5.54\\times 10^20 \\beta\\gamma^2\\varepsilon_0^2l_P^4/l_0^4 where β = 7 for matter and β = 2 in the case of gravity. γ is the Immirzi parameter, ε0 is the cut-off on regulator, lP denotes Planck length, while l0 is a fiducial length defining dimensionless lattice operators. It is worth noting that the object (γ l0/ε0)^2 is a free parameter of the theory. Different prerequisites for fixing values of its components can be used to compare this result with the measured value of the cosmological constant in the Λ-CDM model or with the corrections arising from Quantum Field Theory."
